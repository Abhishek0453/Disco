University timetable optimisation 

The problem of allocating courses to the professors arises due to the preference lists. With similar preferences comes the complexity of keeping everyone happy. Using optimal methods to overcome this issue is a necessity.

This project involves exploring different theories to optimise the course allocation process in a university and select one of them to implement it. The implementation is in the form of a code which takes in all the required constraints and the preferences of each professor and outputs the best allocation it can come up with.

The following constraints are among the main ones: <br>
  -> Profs are divided in 3 category each from which has to take 0.5/1/1.5 course per semester depending on which category he/she belongs to.<br>
  -> A course can be allocated to a professor IFF it is present in the prof's preference list.<br>
  -> All the CDCs have to be alloted no matter what.<br>
  -> A course has to have exactly 1 allotment to it.
